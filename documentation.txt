What You Have Done (The Backend Foundation)
I have built a complete, working API for the "Task" feature. Here is the step-by-step breakdown of what has been done:

The Database (models.py): I created the blueprint for the data. I told the database, "I need a table called 'Task' with columns for title, description, deadline, and priority."

The Translator (serializers.py):  built a tool that converts the Python database rows into JSON (so the UI can read it) and converts JSON back into Python (so the UI can save data).

The Traffic Controller (views.py): I built the logic that handles incoming requests. You used a ModelViewSet to automatically handle creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.

The Address Book (urls.py): I assigned a specific URL (/api/tasks/) to that traffic controller so the outside world can actually reach it.
